    <section id="Introduction">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <img src="images/donkey_kong_nes_cover_art.png" title="DK Cover" alt="dk cover">

            <p> Mario has appeared in well over 200 games since his creation back in 1981. 
            His first apperance was in a game titled <i>Donkey Kong</i>, where he was referred to as 'Jumpman'.
            Donkey Kong was later ported from arcades to the Nintendo Entertainment System. Mario went on to star in
            his own adventure known as <i>Super Mario Bros</i>, which was released in 1985. The gaming industry was
            in the gutter due to an oversaturation of terrible games on other consoles. The release of <i>Super Mario Bros</i>
            is widely considered to have saved the entire industry. </p>
            
            <p>To date, the Mario series has sold a whopping 832,370,000 copies across several different sub-series.
            This includes the series of <i>Super Mario</i>, <i>Mario Kart</i>, <i>Mario Sports</i>, and more.
            </p>

    <!-----------------------CREATOR---------------------------->
    <section class="alternate" id="creator">

        <h2>Creator</h2>

        <img src="images/segale.png" alt="Mario's namesake">

        <p>Mario was created by Japanese video game developer, Shigeru Miyamoto. Initially, Miyamoto wanted Popeye to be the protagonist in Donkey Kong. 
        When that fell through, he created who we all know today as Mario. In <i>Donkey Kong</i>, Mario is a plumber in the sewers of New York trying to
        rescue a princess named Pauline from an ape known as Donkey Kong.</p>
        
        <p>Mario's namesake came from Mario Segale, an employee at Nintendo Seattle.</p>

    <!-----------------------2D TO 3D---------------------------->
    <section id="2dto3d">

        <h2>From 2D to 3D</h2>

        <img src="images/mario_64.png" alt="Mario 64 cover">

        <p>Mario took the leap from 2D to 3D with <i>Super Mario 64</i> on the <i>Nintendo 64</i>. 
        This game is widely considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time.
        <i>Super Mario 64</i> is widely considered to have completely revolutionized 3D gaming
        in ways that can still be felt today within the industry.</p>

        <p>In <i>Super Mario 64</i>, Peach's castle is taken over by Bowser. The only way for Mario to
        rescue her is for him to collect power stars through various worlds by jumping through paintings. 
        There are 120 stars in the game, with 70 being the minimum to beat the game.</p>

    <!-----------------------THEME PARK---------------------------->
    <section class="alternate" id="theme">

        <h2>Theme Park</h2>
        <img src="images/super_nintendo_land.png" alt="Theme Park">
        <p>A Mario theme park was created as a result of a partnership between Universal and Nintendo. 
            It features elements from the games and creates a life-like experience to what it would feel like to be in the games. 
            Super Nintendo Land opened in March 2021 in Japan, and February 2023 in America. There are two additional parks
            being built in Singapore and Orlando, which are scheduled for completion in 2025.</p>

        <p>The theme park uses interactive wristbands that do a variety of different activities.
        One of the coolest uses of the bands in my personal opinion is the <i>Amiibo</i> functionality.
        This allows the bands to be compatible with select <i>Nintendo Switch</i> games in order to receive
        in-game items and rewards.</p>
